# Grav_Sim
Small Python Gravity simulator using pygame
Just wanted to explore python and pygame a little. 
Starts off with a very dense object in the middle of the window, you can create more objects by clicking the mouse.
If you drag the mouse an arrow of increasing size will appear showing you the initial velocity vector 
(the direction of the arrow and the length of the arrow indicates the speed)
